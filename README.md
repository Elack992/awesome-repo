—I speak Spanish, which might surprise some. I've recreated the page as requested. I have to admit, I panicked a little when I saw the blank .html file.

—My commits are poorly done, and both the .html and .css files are a mess—very badly structured. But this was the only way I found to recreate the expected result. Maybe there were better approaches, which I hope to discover later.

Thank you, The Odin Project.
